# Purpose

This "template" folder contains templates and associates scripts to generate
standard repository files such as README.md and LICENSE.  This is primarily
used by the author to ensure consistency across repositories and can safely be
ignored by most end users and contributors.

# Usage

If you do desire to use or process templates in this folder make sure you have
cloned the git repository at <https://git.lenzplace.org/lenzj/repo-template>.
The cloned "repo-template" respository should ideally exist one level outside
this repository root.  I.E. ../repo-template

Once this is in place you can regenerate the documents from templates using the
following command from the main repository folder:

    $ make regenDocMain
